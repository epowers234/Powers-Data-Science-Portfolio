# Emma Powers' First Streamlit App

## Project Overview

Welcome to my first-ever Streamlit app that I created. This is a basic attempt at getting familiar with Streamlit and Python. For this, I found a sample data set that contains the information of 100 different companies that includes basic data about the company such as organizational name, industry type, and when it was founded, to name a few. Then, a user can select one of the organization's names from a dropdown menu to filter out their data.

## Installation and Setup

To code this, VSCode was used. 
<br /> 

If you want to access the app locally, do these steps on your VSCode terminal of the downloaded MLstreamlit.py file:
1. Download streamlit in the terminal by entering this code:
```pip install streamlit```
2. Ensure you are in the correct directory as your file in the terminal by using ```ls``` (only on Mac) to view in your current directory, ```cd foldername``` to go deeper into a folder or go directly into a specific spot.
3. Download the csv file in the data folder above and add it to the corresponding data folder in your computer. 
4. Once in the current location run this code in the terminal: ```streamlit run main.py```
5. Then, a local webpage should pop up and you can work on the app there.
<br />

## Codes and Resources Used
For this app, you only need to ensure that **pandas** and **streamlit** libraries are imported. 

## Data
