# Emma Powers' First Streamlit App

Welcome to my first ever Streamlit app that I created for my data science course. 

## Description

I found a sample data set that contains the information of 100 different companies that includes basic data about the company such as organizational name, industry type, and when it was founded to name a few. Feel free to explore and filter the data with a dropdown menu based on the name of the oranganization!

## How to run:

In the terminal of Visual Studio Code, type out streamlit run basic_streamlit_app/main.py

If the file is in a different location just insert the different path to the file to run the correct Streamlit app.
