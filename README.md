# Emma Powers' Data Science Portfolio

Repository for the projects and work performed in Introduction to Data Science at the University of Notre Dame

## Description

For the spring semester in 2025, I will be expanding on my data science skills and uploading them within this portfolio to track my progress and growth. Projects will include basic data science skills such as data visualization, EDA, ethical research design, LLMs, predictive modeling, etc. 

## Streamlit App

Created a basic Streamlit app that sorts 100 different organizations and their basic information based on the names of the organizations. 

### What I learned:
- How to use Streamlit
- Visualization techniques
- How to make complex looking graphs in a simple and quick manner

## Tidy Data 

Cleaned and used tidy data principles to organize a data set on the medalists from the 2008 Olympic games to create a standardized data set that can be used to create visualizations and pivot tables for analysis using Python and Jupyter Notebooks. Having a strong foundation in data cleaning is an important and necessary step in being a data scientists because this is often the most complex, difficult, and important step in data analysis. 
### What I learned:
- The importance of cleaning and tidying data
- How to generate complex visuals to depict a data set
- Creating pivot tables in Python
- Applying different libraries in one cohesive project

### Example visualization:

## Machine Learning Streamlit App

Back at the start of the semester, we generated a very brief and simple Streamlit app (as seen above). Now, we built upon those basic skills and incorporated our new knowledge of machine learning into a more complex and interactive Streamlit App. I created an app where you can **compare** a logistic regression classifier to a decision tree classifier with your **own** data set. 

Additionally, the app has extensive explanations and definitions of what is occurring, so people with limited background can learn how to interact with the app as they go. It is a perfect way to grow as someone learning machine learning!  

The app will 
1. Upload your data set
2. Process the data
3. Create a machine learning model of your choice
4. Adjust the model outcomes based on your desired hyperparameters
5. Create the corresponding graphs and results depending on the model selected so you can see its' performance
<br /> 

### What I learned:
- How logistic regression and decision tree machine learning models work
- How their hyperparameters affect the model
- Creating a more complex Streamlit interactive app that can be accessed publically
- Applying different models and techniques in a cumulative way
- Grew in my Python skills significantly

### Example of a decision tree generated by the model:

<br /> This graph is generated for users to determine how complex their decision tree becomes with different hyperparameter settings.

### Example of a ROC curve generated by the model for logistic regression models:

<br /> This graph is generated in logistic regression models for users to determine the model's performance and assess how hyperparamaters affect the model's ability to predict the outcome.
