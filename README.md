# Emma Powers' Data Science Portfolio

Repository for the projects and work performed in Introduction to Data Science at the University of Notre Dame

## Description

For the spring semester in 2025, I will be expanding on my data science skills and uploading them within this portfolio to track my progress and growth. Projects will include basic data science skills such as data visualization, EDA, ethical research design, LLMs, predictive modeling, etc.
