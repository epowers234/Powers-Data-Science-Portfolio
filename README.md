# Emma Powers' Data Science Portfolio

Repository for the projects and work performed in Introduction to Data Science at the University of Notre Dame

## Description

For the spring semester in 2025, I will be expanding on my data science skills and uploading them within this portfolio to track my progress and growth. Projects will include basic data science skills such as data visualization, EDA, ethical research design, LLMs, predictive modeling, etc. 

## Streamlit App

Created a basic Streamlit app that sorts 100 different organizations and their basic information based on the names of the organizations. 

### What I learned:
- How to use Streamlit
- Visualization techniques
- How to make complex looking graphs in a simple and quick manner

## Tidy Data 

Cleaned and used tidy data principles to organize a data set on the medalists from the 2008 Olympic games to create a standardized data set that can be used to create visualizations and pivot tables for analysis using Python and Jupyter Notebooks. Having a strong foundation in data cleaning is an important and necessary step in being a data scientists because this is often the most complex, difficult, and important step in data analysis. 
### What I learned:
- The importance of cleaning and tidying data
- How to generate complex visuals to depict a data set
- Creating pivot tables in Python
- Applying different libraries in one cohesive project

### Example visualization:
